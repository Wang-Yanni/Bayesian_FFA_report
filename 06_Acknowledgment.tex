\section*{Acknowledgment}
We gratefully acknowledge Cole Haden Smith from the USACE-RMC for open-sourcing the Numerics library. This resource was instrumental in decoding the DE-MCzS Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler employed in this study. We also deeply appreciate his prompt and insightful responses to our queries regarding posterior calculations, which greatly enhanced the clarity and robustness of our Bayesian analyses.
